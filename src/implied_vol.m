function sigma = implied_vol(c, S0, K, r, t)
% IMPLIED_VOL  Computes the implied volatility for a European call.
%
%  Parameters:
%    Note: parameters are either scalars or vectors; in latter
%          case, they must all have the same dimension.
%
%     c  : call option price at t0
%     S0 : stock price at t0
%     K  : strike price
%     r  : risk free interest rate
%     t  : option expiration time (relative to t0)
%
%  Examples:
%    scalar case:
%       sigma = implied_vol(1.875, 21, 20, 0.1, 0.25);
%    vector case:
%       sigma = implied_vol(1.875, 19:21, 20, 0.1, 0.25);
%
%  Note that if you would like to evaluate at a matrix of points
%  (e.g. via meshgrid) you'll need to reshape the points into columns
%  and then reshape back to matrices after calling.
